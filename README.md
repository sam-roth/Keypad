# Keypad Text Editor

**See the [developer documentation](http://saroth.bitbucket.org/stemdoc/html/).**

**Warning: This program still has many bugs. It is not to be used for anything 
serious at this point.**


Keypad is a text editor written in Python with a flexible plugin system. It was formerly 
known as Stem.

## Design Principles

* **Hackability:** Unlike heavyweight IDEs such as Eclipse, Keypad makes simple
  plugins easy to write. 
* **Flexibility:** Keypad uses a model-view-controller architecture to isolate
  the GUI from the text editing logic, allowing for the possibility of
  additional user interfaces. For instance, it would be possible to build 
  a Curses frontend.
* **Lack of Dogma:** While Keypad is optimized for a certain style of text editing,
  it can be easily modified to suport others.

**Note:** In order to use Clang for code completion, you may need to add a file
to your `PYTHONPATH` with the name `stemrc.py` and the following contents,
substituting the path with one appropriate for your system.

```
#!python
